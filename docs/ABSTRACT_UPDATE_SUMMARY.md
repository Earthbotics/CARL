5. **Scientific Significance**: Added 5 new key advances (1-5) highlighting the v5.15.0 innovations

6. **Conclusion**: Updated to reflect v5.15.0 capabilities and new features

7. **References**: Added foundational AI references:
   - **Turing, A. M. (1950)**: Computing machinery and intelligence
   - **Minsky, M. (1986)**: The society of mind
   - **Minsky, M. (2006)**: The emotion machine
   - **Gordon & Hobbs (2004)**: Formalizations of commonsense psychology

### ABSTRACT.txt Updates

1. **Version Number**: Updated from v5.12.1 to v5.15.0

2. **New Features Section**: Added "Version 5.15.0 New Features" subsection with:
   - Reliable Vision Transport
   - Gordon & Hobbs Commonsense Reasoning
   - Humor and Laughter System
   - Comprehensive Session Reporting
   - Enhanced Imagination System
   - Structured Vision Events
   - Typed Axioms
   - Cultural Sensitivity
   - Memory Thumbnail Assignment

3. **References Section**: Added formal references section including:
   - Baars (1988) - Global Workspace Theory
   - Tononi (2004) - Integrated Information Theory
   - Myers & Briggs (1962) - MBTI

   - Speer et al. (2017) - ConceptNet
   - Vaswani et al. (2017) - Transformer architecture

## Key Additions

### Foundational AI References
- **Turing, A. M. (1950)**: Computing machinery and intelligence - CARL implements Turing's vision of machine intelligence through conversation and personality simulation
- **Minsky, M. (1986)**: The society of mind - CARL's multi-system architecture directly implements Minsky's theory of specialized mental agents
- **Minsky, M. (2006)**: The emotion machine - CARL's emotional and decision-making systems reflect Minsky's multi-layered cognitive framework

### Gordon & Hobbs Reference
- **Paper**: Gordon, A. S., & Hobbs, J. R. (2004). Formalizations of commonsense psychology. AI Magazine, 25(4), 77-90.
- **Implementation**: "Accessibility by Association" model for strategic planning commonsense
- **Features**: Typed axioms (preconditions, effects, sequences, abnormality markers)
- **Integration**: ConceptNet expansion and validation

### New System Features Highlighted
1. **VisionTransport**: Reliable ARC→Flask vision pipeline with circuit breaker patterns
2. **CommonsenseAxioms**: Gordon & Hobbs implementation with ConceptNet integration
3. **HumorSystem**: Rule-based and LLM-fallback humor detection with laughter reflex
4. **SessionReporter**: Comprehensive end-of-session analytics and reporting
5. **ImaginationSystem**: Enhanced API with DALL·E hologram rendering

## Technical Accuracy
All updates maintain technical accuracy and properly reference the scientific literature. The Gordon & Hobbs implementation is correctly described as providing "Accessibility by Association" for strategic planning commonsense reasoning.

## Verification
- ✅ Main module imports successfully after updates
