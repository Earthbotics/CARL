## 🚀 Development Priorities

### **Critical Issues from v9.0.0 Testing (RESOLVED IN v9.3.10122025)**

#### 1. Context-Aware Inner Self System (CRITICAL PRIORITY) ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: No single-focus attention management system
**Impact**: CARL lacked human-like attention and focus management
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive attention management system with focus arbitration

#### 2. Enhanced Memory Recall System (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: CARL not searching local memory before API calls
**Impact**: Inefficient API usage and poor toy/object recognition
**Solution**: Implemented local memory priority system with comprehensive search hierarchy

#### 3. Robust Shutdown Management (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Background processes continued running after "Stop Bot"
**Impact**: System instability and resource leaks
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive shutdown flag system and process lifecycle management

#### 4. Vision-Memory Connection Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Vision system not connecting detected objects to local memory
**Impact**: Poor object recognition and memory integration
**Solution**: Enhanced vision system with things directory search and concept matching
